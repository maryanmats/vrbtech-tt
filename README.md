# VRBTech TT

This project is built using React, Redux, and MobX to display a list of articles. Users can add or remove articles (only those created by the user). Users can also pin an item, meaning the item has to be the first in the list. Only one pinned item is allowed. Items can be searched by name or description. 

The application also includes a page where 10 articles are displayed from NewsAPI, and a button that allows the user to load an additional 10 articles. The articles should not be repeated if the user clicks the button multiple times.
